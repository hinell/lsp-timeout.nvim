## GIT WORKFLOW
It's highly likely that this project is going to be
[force-pushed](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push#Documentation/git-push.txt)
and aggressively [squash-rebased](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase) into specific semver versions.
Take into account this fact when making a PR: it is likely render your
base-commits obsolete.

## BUILD
### Dev dependencies
* **[GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)** - required for `make` command; should be already installed on *nix systems
* **[ts-vimdoc](https://github.com/ibhagwan/ts-vimdoc.nvim)** - the tool is used to generate doc/*.txt files from README.md
* **[LuaFormatter](https://github.com/Koihik/LuaFormatter)** - lua code formatter; much faster than `stylua` 
quick install via npm: `npm i -g stylua`
