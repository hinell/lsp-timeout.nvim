# CONTRIBUTING

### Open-source, not Open-contributing
This project is Open-source, meaning you can make as many copies of it as you want and do whatever you want with the code as long as you are not trying to commercialize it, but it IS NOT open-contribution. In order to keep this library in the public domain and ensure that the code remains usable and does not become contaminated with proprietary or strictly-licensed content or code that is hard to maintain, the project does not accept patches from people who have not submitted an affidavit dedicating their contribution to the author of this project or public domain.

All of the code have been written specifically for use by it; NO code has been copied from unknown sources on the internet unless explicitly specified.

### Alternatives: plugins
The project is open for requests to expose APIs for plugins so you can safely extend it by maintaining a separate project. Consider creating a plugin instead of a requesting merging with your fork. 

### If your contribution is ever accepted
If your contribution is ever accepted, You:
* waive all your legal rights to any textual or visual contribution you make to this project
* wholly transfer the said rights to the author of this project
* accept the fact that the said contribution is subject to change and may be changed beyound recognition
